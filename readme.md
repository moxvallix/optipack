# OptiPack
## QOL Optimisation Pack

OptiPack has long been a private pack of mods I have collected for my friends, most of whom play Minecraft on computers with processing power rivaling that of a potato (looking at you Wulfian!)

It is a pack that has been fine-tuned to fit our play style. I started making the pack as I wanted my friends to use the Fabric mod launcher, but still have all the features of OptiFine, but overtime was expanded to have other mods that would improve our gameplay experience, and deal with common gripes and problems we would encounter with the base game.

## Keybinds
- `c`: Zoom
- `o`: Manage Shaders
- `F4`: Custom HUD (Alternate/Better F3 Screen)

## License
I am not very sure how a modpack is meant to be licensed. I didn't make any of these mods, but I guess my particular configuration can be licensed? IDK. Each mod has it's own license, which can be found with the provided links above. As for my particular configuration, saved in this modpack, I just went with unlicense.
